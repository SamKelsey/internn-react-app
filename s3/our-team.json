After experiencing first-hand how difficult it is to find clients as a young photographer and seeing some of the photos people were using to advertise their properties, I was determined to create internn as a platform that can help both students and property owners.",

I've been invested in photography for a few years now, undertaking many different styles, from events to photojournalism. The latest I've been enjoying is property photography. Taking pictures of interiors is particularly tricky and you need someone to do it right! From personal experience as a student, having well lit pictures has meant the difference between renting a place or letting it go. I hope I will be able to offer you this quality and get your property noticed!",
